WHAT WAS BROKEN & WHAT I FIXED
==============================================

PROBLEM 1: Dashboard Not Loading
CAUSE: Broken HTML with conflicting JavaScript imports

CAUSE: No analysis dashboard with search functionality
FIX: Built complete search dashboard with real-time filtering
RESULT: ✅ Search works with 4 filter criteria

PROBLEM 4: No Routes to New Dashboards
